## Description:
When it comes to rock climbing, as with any sport, practice makes perfect. But when you’re out there puzzling out route after route, it can be difficult to keep track of the progress you’ve been making. Pen and paper are cumbersome, and memory is faulty. Puzzle will be an app designed to help rock climbers effortlessly keep track of their climbing achievements while providing a steady stream of motivation and support by connecting them with the rock climbing community.
With the help of this app, climbers will be able to add climbing routes to their individual profiles and to track how well they performed on those routes during each attempt. Progress will be tracked via the number of times a climber fell, with the exception of speed climbing, which (as the name suggests) is a type of rock climbing that keeps track of progress via time.
Climbers will also be able to subscribe to climbing gyms, on whose profiles they will not only be able to obtain information on the gym’s climbing routes but also to stay up-to-date on any competitions or other events the gym is planning.
For ease of access, Puzzle will be designed as a web app. A stable internet connection will be all it takes for climbers to record their progress from a wide array of devices and for climbing gyms to cheer them along.
